    <section id="Background">
        <h3>Where did I come from?</h3>
        I was born Essex and raised near Framlingham in suffolk (in the east of england). Framlingham is a rural town, known for little other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran" target="blank">Ed Sheeran</a> and is home to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0ibBPhiaG0"  target="blank">"Castle on the Hill."</a>
        at which I spent a lot of time whilst growing up.
        <h3>Where did I go?</h3>
        I was taught at <a href="https://www.thomasmills.suffolk.sch.uk/" target="blank">Thomas Mills High School</a> where I also went to sixth form, before moving to Birmingham to study mathematics.

            <h4>Dungeons and Dragons</h4>
             I've made a habit of filling what little free time I find with as many events as possible. Including running games of Dungeons and Dragons (a hobby all should try!). <br>

             Most recently, I've begun a new story in the world of Shengxiao (custom made map below) <br>

            <h4>Card Games and Board Games</h4>
             When I'm not writing or playing in fantasy stories, I enjoy (or enjoyed pre-Covid) spending time with friends playing board games and card games. <br>
